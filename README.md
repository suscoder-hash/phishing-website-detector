# Phishing Website Detector
This project presents an AI-powered Phishing Website Detector designed to combat the growing threat of online phishing attacks. 
Leveraging machine learning (ML), this system analyzes various characteristics of a given URL—such as its structure, domain properties, and content-based features—to classify it as either legitimate or a potential phishing threat. 
Developed using Python (Flask) for the backend and a modern web interface for user interaction, this tool provides a proactive and intelligent defense against fraudulent websites. 
It's a practical demonstration of applying AI to enhance cybersecurity.
